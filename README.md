[Documentation](https://github.com/akaspin/calcium/blob/master/docs/index.md).

Calcium is another Javascript/MVC bicycle. It's not framework, just set of 
components. It heavily inspired by Backbone and Spine but, in contrast, has 
the following objectives:

- Avoid overbloated "god" objects. 
- Minimal memory usage. Using RISK-like architecture.
* Completely predictable behavior.
* Browser-first. Support for node.js only if it does not interfere.

# Dependencies

Calcium depends to *underscore.js* (or *lodash.js*). For ajax and DOM 
manipulations, some Calcium components uses *jQuery* (or *Zepto*).
